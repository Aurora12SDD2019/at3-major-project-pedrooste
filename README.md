## RACING TO THE END OF THE UNIVERSE

Racing to the end of the universe is a game developed by Pedro Oste for Dr Goldrick, owner of the resturaunt '*end of the universe*'. This game consists of a player racing down the road where he will have to avoid oncomming obstacles, ie cars, getting harder as the player progresses. A score is kept and updates as each car is passed, adding this score to the leaderboard when the player finally crashes.

# Sprint 1:
- Sprint 1 isnt really a major step, consider it more experiemting with the button functunality
- This sprint consists of buttons and text made through modules (later updated in sprint 2 as classes) where a print statement (debugging) will run if the button has been clicked.
