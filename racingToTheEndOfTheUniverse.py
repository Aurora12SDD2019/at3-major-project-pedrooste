""" revision notes:
- Sprint 1:
    Experimentation of design, what works, what doesnâ€™t ?
- Sprint 2:
    Menu screens added
    Basic game development with little graphics
    Playable gamplay
- Sprint 3:
    Added progressive difficult to the game
    Added a score which updates after each car has passed
    Added a variety of enemy cars with different hit boxes
- Sprint 4:
    Highscore board developed
- Sprint 5:
    Graphics introduced for all models
    Finalisation of any details
